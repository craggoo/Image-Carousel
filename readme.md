Most browsers by default block CORS requests so you need to download a plugin that will allows CORS requests to go through. If your browser is Chrome, there is a plugin in the Chrome Store that does just this.

The app is setup to be best viewed with a 1920*1200 resolution. If you use any other resolution things will look out of place.
